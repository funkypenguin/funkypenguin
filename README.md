# ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, fellow geeks!

I'm David.

I've spent 20+ years working with technology.

I'm a contracting IT consultant, with a broad range of experience and skills. I'm an [AWS Certified Solution Architect (Professional)](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/a0c4a196-55ab-4472-b46b-b610b44dc00f/public_url), a CNCF-Certified [Kubernetes Administrator](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/cd307d51-544b-4bc6-97b0-9015e40df40d/public_url) and [Application Developer](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/9ed9280a-fb92-46ca-b307-8f74a2cccf1d/public_url), a [helm-chart developer](https://geek-cookbook.github.io/charts/), and a remote worker. I've written a [book](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/phplist-2-e-mail-campaign-manager), and I [blog](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz) on topics that interest me.

My geekiest accomplishment is the establishment of [Funky Penguin's Geek's Cookbook ](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz), originally to record my journey in setting up an optimal HA cloud platform for my own, self-hosted use. In the process, I'm learning new skills re cloud architecture, container orchestration, continuous integration, and automation.

I apply my skills (and curiosity) to interesting short and long-term international opportunities.
