# ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, fellow geeks!

I'm David.

I've spent 20+ years working with technology.

I'm a contracting IT consultant, with a broad range of experience and skills. I'm an AWS Certified Solution Architect (Professional), a remote worker, I've written a book, and I blog on topics that interest me.

My geekiest accomplishment is [Funky Penguin's Geek's Cookbook ](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz) to record my journey in setting up an optimal HA cloud platform for my own, self-hosted use. In the process, I'm learning new skills re cloud architecture, container orchestration, continuous integration, and automation.
